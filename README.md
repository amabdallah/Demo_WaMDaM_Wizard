# Demo the WaMDaM Wizard



## What is WaMDaM?

The Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) is a new method to to organize, identify, and compare  water management data for systems models. 

Think of WaM-DaM as a repository of water management data (purple cylinder) and a translator between numerous data sources on the left and different models on the right (see flowchart). WaM-DaM translates two aspects of the data: the syntax (i.e., structure) and semantics (terminology). WaM-DaM will speed the time to find, organize, and synthesize data from different data sources, and prepare data for modeling.

## Why WaMDaM?   
WaMDaM enabels researchers and water managers to organize water management data with two keys aspects that are not supported by existing methods: 
i) represents the connectivity between system componenets (e.g., demand site, reservoir). It also tracks the configueratons of networks and changes in their topology and data through scenarios
ii) represents one or all these data types: 1) dual values (e.g., binary), 2) numeric values, 3) descriptor values, 4) seasonal numeric values, 5) files, 6) time series, 7) multi-attribute series (i.e., multi-columns).  


# Demo instructions

1. Download the WaMDaM Wizard executable. It works on Windows [7 and 10] 64 bit operating systems 
https://bft.usu.edu/96zs3
Double click at the executable. You should see this window. Hopefully it is self-explantatory to work with.
