# Demo the WaMDaM Wizard


## What is WaMDaM?

The Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) is a new method to to organize, identify, and compare  water management data for systems models. 

Think of WaM-DaM as a repository of water management data (purple cylinder) and a translator between numerous data sources on the left and different models on the right (see flowchart). WaM-DaM translates two aspects of the data: the syntax (i.e., structure) and semantics (terminology). WaM-DaM will speed the time to find, organize, and synthesize data from different data sources, and prepare data for modeling. If you're curious, see WaMDaM schema here: http://amabdallah.github.io/test2/diagrams/01_WaMDaM_NoCVs.html

## Why WaMDaM?   
WaMDaM enabels researchers and water managers to organize water management data with two keys aspects that are not supported by existing methods:    
**i)** represents the connectivity between system componenets (e.g., demand site, reservoir). It also tracks the configueratons of networks and changes in their topology and data through scenarios.   
**ii)** represents one or all these data types: 1) dual values (e.g., binary), 2) numeric values, 3) descriptor values, 4) seasonal numeric values, 5) files, 6) time series, 7) multi-attribute series (i.e., multi-columns).  


## Why WaMDaM Wizard?   
The WaMDaM Wizard is an open-source, cross-platfom, Python-based graphaical user software to interact with WaMDaM database. Users are not expected to understand the underlying WaMDaM database of schema. The Wizard mainly allows users to:    
**i)**   Load and validate data from a specific spreadsheet template   
**ii)**  Use data preparation tools to help manipulate and transform users data to fit into the spreadsheet template.  
**iii)** Import data direclty from supported web-services (e.g., time series data from CUAHSI)  
**iv)**  Use pre defined funtions to query and compare data from multiple datasets loaded in WaMDaM   
**v)**   Export data loaded into WaMDaM to multiple supported models   



# Demo instructions (pre-workshop)

1. Download the WaMDaM Wizard executable. It works on Windows [7 and 10] 64 bit operating systems 
https://bft.usu.edu/96zs3
Double click at the executable. You should see this window. Hopefully it is self-explantatory to work with.
