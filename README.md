# Demo the WaMDaM Wizard



## What is WaMDaM

The Water Management Data Model (WaMDaM) is a new method to to organize, identify, and compare  water management data for systems models. 

Think of WaM-DaM as a repository of water management data (purple cylinder) and a translator between numerous data sources on the left and different models on the right (see flowchart). WaM-DaM translates two aspects of the data: the syntax (i.e., structure) and semantics (terminology). WaM-DaM will speed the time to find, organize, and synthesize data from different data sources, and prepare data for modeling.
